# NewtonLaw-test-001


# Target:  
calculate ==> "cal" for short <br>
To cal Newton Law about real earth R, Mass, gravity to moon .. <br>
and g = 9.8 m/(sec^2) is special case or general case !! <br>
  also cal three obj problem, sun moon earth move real position in Orbit of sun system . <br>
  if have time, cal 9 planets together with real Newtone Law simulation !! <br>
  if have time, plot 3d graph with real time position (used this simulation compare NASA data ...) <br>
  if have time, plot all start position with (x,y,z) in this simulation to set STAR CHAR <br>
  with sun as coordinates zero point. <br>
  also can transformation to use earth as coordinates zero point, as tradisional STAR CHAR <br>
<br>
G = 6.67*10^(-11)<br>
<br>
earth surface               g = 9.8<br>

earth                       R = ......<br>
earth                    mass = .......<br>
earth to sun distance     1AU = .......<br>
<br>
sun mass                      = ......<br>

moon mass                     = ........
moon distance to earth        = .......
