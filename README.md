# NewtonLaw-test-001


# Target:  
To cal Newton Law about real earth R, Mass, gravity to moon .. and g = 9.8 m/(sec^2) is special case or general case !!
  also cal three obj problem, sun moon earth move real position in Orbit of sun system .
  if have time cal 9 planets together with real Newtone Law simulation !!
  if have time plot 3d graph with real time position (used this simulation compare NASA data ...)
